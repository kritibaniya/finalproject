    <!--PROBLEM-->
  <div class="problem-content">
  <div class="col-small-60">
    <h1>UN's sustainable development goal</h1>
      <p> “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” is twelfth
          sustainable development goal set by the United Nation. It involves topic
          like recycling, reuse, management of chemicals and much more. Another
          underlying target is also to “halve per capita global food waste at
          the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses (…)”. This is
          what our project is based on and at the same time is contributing to
          reach the goal set by UN. It will not only benefit us and our
          generation, but also every upcoming generations and our whole mother
          earth. We often feel like goals are easy to set but hard to accomplish.
          However, we should always try our best because, it is the only way to succeed.
          These goals might look very farfetched, but they are still feasible. </p>

    <!--SOLUTION-->
    <div class=" col-small-60">
      <h1>Why we chose this problem? </h1>
        <p>Us from The Neat are passionate about taking care of our environment.
          That is why we are concerned about global issue of food waste. Every
          year we throw tons of edible food on garbage. When we waste food, we
          are also wasting money, resources, farmers hard work and dedication.
          Therefore, wasting food is somehow destruction of our world. </p>

  <!--OUR FUTURE-->
    <div class="col-small-60">
      <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
      <p>It is super important to reduce food waste because we absolutely cannot
         afford it. We need to properly utilize every grain produced because,
         there are millions of people suffering from malnutrition and some are
         even starving to death. </p>


<pre>Let’s do some calculation:
  According to theworldscount.com, around 9 million people loses their life due to startvation.
  Numbers from undp.org shows that we waste more than 1.3trillion tons of food a year.
  If we divide 1.3 trillion by 9million we get 144444.4.
  Our calculation shows that if we divided the wasted food to those 9 million who died.
  They would get 144444.4. ton food per person. This is clearly way above what a person eats in a year.
  Hence proved that only if we were better at dividing food properly among us, no one would have died due to starvation.

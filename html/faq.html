    <h1>FAQ - frequently asked questions </h1>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Can I use the app without creating a user?</h3>
      <p> <a-letter>A:</a-letter> No, you can not use the app without creating a user. You must create one before you can use the app.
          It does not take much time, and you can authenticate yourself later. However, you can not use the app to its
          full extent and get all the information available on it, without authorizing the account.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="authorize">
      <h3>Q: Why do I need to authenticate myself?</h3>
        <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> The reason behind authentication is the safety of all the users. In this way we know that all the users are real persons.
          If something unpleasant happens or if someone does not follow our guidelines, it will be easier for us to take action.
          One can not see any information about the other users until one has autorized the account.
          </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Will the authenication process be secure?</h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> BankID is a key component in a number of solutions in many different industries. It is used by all the country's banks, public
        digital services and by an increasing number of companies in various industries.<a href="sources.html#source6" target="_blank">[source 6]</a>
        We wanted a secure and easy authentication on our app,, so we know who the users are. BankID gives us exactly this. We have
        authentication excluding person number, so you do not have to worry about misuse of it. The information we will get is: name,
        mobile number, mailadress, date of birth and adress. This information will only be used when we need to contact you.
        Reason behind this is that we want to sustain and maintain a secure relationship with the users.
        In addition to, assure the users that everyone on this app are real people who have been verified.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Do you need a profile picture of me? Will my photo be shown to everybody? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> Profile picture is not mandatory, but it will make a lot more pleasent experience for the other users. If you know how the
        other person behind the phone screen looks like, then it will be easier for you to take contact.
        Your profile picture will not be visible for the users who have not been authenticated their account.
        <p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: What kind of information about me will be visible to others? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> No information about you will be visible for accounts that have not been authenticated.
        Otherwise, your name will be visible to everyone and the city you live in.
        You are free to choose whether your profile picture and address may be visible to others or not.
        If you have chosen to the dine in option and the address of the giver is not visible,
        you can send a message to that person about it.
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Who can I send messages to? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> You can send messages to the previous giver you have contacted and also to the ones you
        will contact in the future reagrding their post.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: I changed the view type for “Explore Food” from list to map. How can I change it back to list type? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> There is a button at the top on the right corner. If the view type is map, there will be a icon resembling
        a list which you can click on to get back to the list menu. Vice versa, if the view type is list, there will be a icon
        resembling a map, which you can click on to get the map view. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: What will happen to my post after the time limit expires? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> When the time limit of a post expires, it will not be visible to the other users. You will get the option to either renew it
        if the food still is edible, or else you can delete it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: The food I want to post is neither meal, snack or groceries. What should i choose? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> We have an easy solution for this problem. If the food is already prepared or cooked, you can post it under meal.
        If it is raw material you can post it under groceries. The giver should try to chose the option which suits the food most,
        so that the possibilty for it being given away is higher. This will help us reash our goal to descrease food waste! </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Do I have to eat the food with the host if it has been posted in dine in category? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> You must contact the host and ask about it yourself. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Do I have to post a picture of the food? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> No, you do not have to post a photo of the food. However, keep in mind that the probability for it being takes is elevated.
      In this way, it will be clearer for the users if it is edible for them or not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Can I trust that the users who have posted are real? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> Yes, that's why users must authenticate their account before they can use the app to its full extent. However, this is like
        every other app where the user decide themselves and take full responsibilty for their actions. Although, we can assure you that
        if something inappropriate happens, we will take actions. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: How can I know if the food is edible? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> It is the giver's responsible that the food is comestible. If not we will act in accordance with our guidelines, and one of
        the consequenses can be deletion of the user's account. The taker also have the duty to ensure that the food is eatable before
        consuming it. Use the "see, smell and taste" technique used in Norway.

        <b>See:</b> <em> Can you see mold, grime or other changes with the food?
          Does it have difference appearance or color than normally? </em> <br>

        <b>Smell:</b> <em>"Does the food smell as it should or does it smell rotten, fermented, sour
          or in other ways different than it should?</em> <br>

        <b>Taste:</b><em> "Does the food taste as expected or does it have a sour or rancid aftertaste?
          Remember that you do not get sick from tasting some bad food."</em>

      <h3>Q: What if I get food poisoning? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> If you are sick and suspect that it is caused by food or drink, consult a doctor. immidietally.
         Please contact us also immidietally, so we can assist you and do our own inquiery.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: I had a bad experience with another user. What should I do? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> There is a feature called "experience" in the menu, where you can share your experience.
         We will review it and follow the case further. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>Q: Why don't you guys have a reward system like many other apps? </h3>
      <p><a-letter>A:</a-letter> The reason we do not have a premium system is that we are very committed to reach our goal; reduction in food waste.
        We could have a prize system where people would get points for every time they posted, or something similar.
        But a consequence of this could be that people deliberately made extra portions of food,
        just to post it on the app. This would go against our mission. </p>

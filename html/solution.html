              <p>NEat is a smartphone app that promotes collaboration, unity and
                sharing, while leading the way to an eco-friendlier society.</p>

              <p>The app is based on posting leftover food and giving it away
                to others, and that with no costs. Maybe you managed to make
                a portion too much for dinner, or that there was extra food
                left after a celebration. You may not have the capacity to
                store the food, and your only solution is to throw out the
                food. But, with the app we offer you a solution to the problem.
                Instead of throwing the food away, you can post it on the app
                and give it away to someone who may need it more.  At the same
                time as a user, you will be notified if there are leftover food
                or vegetables in your local area. You can thus drop by and pick
                it up, or if they want, stay and eat with them. </p>
                <br>
              <p>But, what if for various reasons you do not want to provide
                your address, or that it is time consuming for people to travel
                to your home. That is why we have chosen to open food trucks.
                The food trucks will be central and easily accessible. Here
                people can drop by with their leftover food and vegetables.
                The food will be quality assured and registered in the app by
                the worker. This allows people to log in to the app and see
                what type of food is available in the food truck. When the
                food is no longer available, it will be removed from the app.</p>
                <br>
              <p>In order to operate the food truck, we depend on sponsors,
                considering that our solution is based on no costs. Therefore,
                should the app become popular and people show a lot of interest,
                people and companies may be willing to sponsor the idea, given
                its good purpose.</p>

    <!-- HOW WILL IT HELP SOCIERT TOWARD A GREATER DIRECTION  -->
        <div id="society" class="content">
          <h1>How will it help society toward a greater direction?</h1>
          <br>
          <p>The app will manly start up in Norway before it is expanded to
            other countries and places. <br>In Norway, more than 390,000 tons
            of edible food is thrown away every year. And the household sector
            alone accounts for more than half of this food waste; 58%.
            <em>(https://www.matsentralen.no/matsvinn)</em>By encouraging people to
            share the extra food they have left, instead of throwing it away,
            will lead to a big change and difference in numbers. Even if the
            action is small, the effect of it is great, both towards society
            and oneself. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Even studies show that giving and sharing, will boost ones
              physical and mental health. The health benefits can include:</p>

            <h1>Our Next step</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Our next step with our project is aimed at smaller communities.
              Considering that we have food trucks in central parts of the
              country, we wanted to find a solution for smaller areas. </p>
              <br>
            <p>Our idea is based on cabinets with built-in cooling element, so
              that the food does not get bad. The cabinets will be located in
              central locations in the various local communities. For example,
              if you as a donor have posted a post on the app, and someone has
              shown interest in it. Instead of the person visiting your house,
              you can leave the food in one of the cupboards, lock it, and send
              the code and cupboard number to him / her here. This allows them
              to drop by and pick up the food when it suits them best.</p>
